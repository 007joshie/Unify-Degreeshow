            <h2>biography</h2>

            <p>Hihi! My name is Megan and I will be graduating soon with a Bachelor of Design, majoring in Communication
                Design and Marketing. Despite being pushed to become a doctor or lawyer, I insisted on pursuing the
                design field and here I am now.
            </p>

            <p>
                Initially, my dream was to become a fashion designer and this has been with me ever since childhood. In
                fact, I still carry that dream with me. However, I started gaining interest in graphic design after
                seeing the attractive work created by some of my graphic designer friends and it made me think that
                maybe I should take this field into consideration. My determination became stronger after realising that
                everything in this world eventually involves design. Hence, I started my graphic design journey at The
                University of Waikato while studying marketing alongside. At the start, I was intimidated by everything
                and everyone because I felt that I didn’t have the aptitude for drawing. But as time passed, I found
                myself becoming more confident to share my work as I learned that design is not only limited to drawing.
                This showed how much I have improved as a designer as I am proud to own my work. In the past 3 years, I
                have picked up many essential skills such as coding, motion graphics, UX design, etc that I had never
                expected myself to learn as a graphic designer because my original concept of graphic design was limited
                to branding and print. I’m happy that I was given the opportunity to learn such a broad range of skills
                and software because this broadens my future job employment scope. Thanks to my lecturers, tutors, and
                peers, studying here at Waikato helped me develop a sharper pair of eyes and I now have a keener sense
                of what makes a design more effective. Throughout my design journey, I found myself enjoying projects
                related to branding, motion graphics, and UX design.

            <h2>project description</h2>

            <p>
                Many people tend to overestimate themselves by over-ordering and leaving leftovers in restaurants. This
                contributes to more than 24,000 tonnes of food waste being generated annually by New Zealand restaurants
                and cafes. From that amount, 61% of the food waste is avoidable as it includes edible food. It may not
                be visible to everyone but in fact many New Zealanders are living with food insecurity. This percentage
                has increased to 20% especially with the outbreak of the current pandemic. The reason that many people
                are unable to feed themselves is due to being financially affected.
                <br><br>
                In this case, I saw a link between both problems and came forward with a food rescue organisation called
                ‘Occasion’. The organisation intends to work with New Zealand restaurants and cafes to reduce food waste
                and food insecurity by feeding the poor so edible food does not end up as waste. Occasion is different
                from other similar existing organisations because while we involve restaurants and cafes, we also give
                customers the opportunity to participate in the movement, making it more meaningful for everyone.
                <br><br>
                To educate people about Occasion, I have created a set of advertising posters, an infographic poster and
                postcards, a table flip booklet, and an order form. Stickers and gift tags were also created to enhance
                and support the branding of Occasion.
