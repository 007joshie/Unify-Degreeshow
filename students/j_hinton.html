            <h2>biography</h2>

            <p>Hi there! My name is Joel Hinton, and I am a design student who will hopefully be soon graduating with a
                Bachelor of Design, majoring in media design. I have always been a visual person and since my early
                years in high school I joined a design class and have never looked back.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have always gravitated to visual media. I’ve always been obsessed with aesthetics and what makes
                something visually appealing. As a kid I created a lot, whether it was a character for a comic, or just
                a page full of a random assortment of colors, nothing stopped me from experimenting. And as I grew older
                that obsession with aesthetic and design blossomed, turning me into the designer I am now. During my
                time at Waikato, I have learned more and more about my personal style, what I like about design, what I
                dislike. But mainly it has allowed me to see the passion shared by many other like-minded people. The
                technical side of design, while important, isn’t what interests me. What does interest me is seeing
                other people grow as artists, how their style evolves, how they can bend design to their will, creating
                something unique and ‘very them’. That’s what I love about design. I just love creating, expressing
                myself visually and seeing others doing the same.
            </p>

            <h2>project description</h2>

            <p>Our film was inspired by the quote from the First things First 2020 manifesto
                <br> <br>We created social media posts to advertise our film ‘It Breathes’. as well as this we created a
                website to show off our concept work, such as photography and behind the scenes.
                <br> <br>“We must understand that we are not outside of nature; we are part of a complex system, and our
                actions must reflect that knowledge”.
                <br> <br>It Breathes is a short film based around the idea of the importance of human connection, of
                human consequence and how we can better ourselves and the world through change. It’s a film that I feel
                really wants to give hope to the viewers.
                <br> <br>It’s not afraid to show how a broken world can affect us as people, how it will change our way
                of life. But it’s also not afraid to show how strong the bonds of humanity are, and how even in the
                darkest of times we can still fix things.
                <br> <br>We hope it can breathe new life into the word ‘Hope’.

            </p>
