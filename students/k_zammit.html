            <h2>biography</h2>

            <p>Hello, my name is Karlos Zammit and I will be graduating this year with a Bachelor of Design. The last
                three years of my studies here at The University of Waikato I have learnt a tremendous amount and have
                been a part of such an amazing group of designers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Throughout college I never really thought about the importance of design and never really knew what was
                involved. I always associated design with art or drawing. Once I realised what went into design and how
                important it is, then I got hooked. Design is in everything and the opportunity to be as creative as
                possible really makes it an enjoyable career. The past three years studying here at Waikato have taught
                me a lot, I have learnt how to manage my time efficiently, I have also developed a wide range of skills
                in design. My passion for UX/UI design has grown tremendously..
            </p>

            <h2>project description</h2>

            <p>
                Looking after your health is important, but it seems that New Zealanders are not that educated in how to
                do so, nor do they know what is inside the foods they are eating. One in every three New Zealander’s are
                obese, this is quite a concerning number although it can be reduced by changing two important factors in
                peoples lives. Diet and exercise.
                <br><br>
                Through “Summit Health & Fitness” I have created an app that allows users to track their food, track
                their exercise, create, and browse different food menus that will help them with their personal goals.
                Making people more aware about their fitness choices is the goal, having someone think about what they
                are about to eat or what kind of exercise they will be doing for the day instinctively- this is the
                outcome I’m wanting. I have also created a series of three posters that promote the “Summit Health &
                Fitness” app.
