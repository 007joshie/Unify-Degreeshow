            <h2>biography</h2>

            <p>Hello! I am Zac Holley, and I will graduate with a Bachelor of Design majoring in Communication Design
                and minoring in Media Design at the end of this year. I have always had a passion for design and art and
                am happy to have been able to explore that at The University of Waikato.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was always interested in art and other creative outlets growing up, but it wasn’t until I came to
                Waikato that I understood it could be a potential career path for me. Through studying, I’ve been able
                to figure out who I am as a designer and what design looks like for me. I’ve been able to find my own
                style when it comes to design, realising I enjoy and excel in poster design and branding. Studying
                design at Waikato has allowed me to turn an interest into a skill and I am excited to see where that
                leads to from here.
            </p>

            <h2>project description</h2>

            <p>Just in Auckland animal shelters alone, almost eight dogs a day are being euthanised due to a lack of
                space and dogs being deemed “unadoptable.” This project is based around a service that allows people to
                sponsor dogs that are in these shelters until they find a new home. These sponsors would help to fund
                shelters so that they can provide the proper care, have the facilities to hold more dogs, and
                rehabilitate those who are currently “unadoptable.”
                <br><br>
                As part of this service, sponsors will get to choose a shelter dog to watch over. A sponsor for one of
                these dogs gets a welcome package with photos of the dog and information about them, an Underdogs
                t-shirt, and an assortment of stickers, all in a box that doubles as a package to send back to the dog
                they are sponsoring. Sponsors can fill the box with toys and treats for their sponsored dog and the
                other dogs at the shelter. Each sponsor is also updated with their dog's progress at the shelter and
                when they get adopted, to make the journey feel special between them and their sponsored dog. The aim of
                the service is to reduce the number of dogs that are being put down in these shelters and give them a
                better chance of finding a home and a family.
