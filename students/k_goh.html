            <h2>biography</h2>

            <p>Hello! My name is Kae Shiann Goh, known as Sam as well. A year ago, I decided to continue my stay in New
                Zealand and further my education by studying Media Design (Graduate Diploma) at The University of
                Waikato. I am a concept artist, illustrator, and designer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ever since I was young, I have been really interested in art and design. At first, I thought of it as a
                hobby, an expression of emotion to draw, create, and design something from scratch. I used to work in an
                animation company before further study. Other than that, I have always been interested in creating short
                videos too, to be able to tell a story. Storytelling is really something I am interested in but afraid
                to venture into. I always think that maybe I am not good enough, my idea might not be accepted, or maybe
                I am just afraid to get rejected. Even though all those thoughts came to my mind, I still took the
                courage to step out of my comfort zone, hence I chose to study art and design and start from the bottom.
                I wish to tell people stories that are able to touch their heart. I crave for a good story with a good
                message in it that is able to pass on year after year, because one day, our future generations will look
                back, and use our art and design, our stories as an inspiration for their study material.

            </p>

            <h2>project description</h2>

            <p>This project is to design a solution for people to deal with their emotional state. They will learn to
                embrace their feelings and thus control them. All of us are living in this society, having busy lives,
                working every day, every hour. Once in a while we should play some games to help ourselves relax and
                de-stress. This game design – ‘AEONS’ that I will be creating is full of meaningful ideas; it closely
                relates to our daily lives. As we enter the game and explore, it will help us understand ourselves
                better and know that it is inter-connected.
            </p>

            <p>
                ‘AEONS’ is designed for young adults in the age group of 13 to 29. They are at the age of stepping into
                the adult world, the society, not knowing anything, but trying their best to learn and adapt. However,
                they often get bullied by the work culture, feeling depressed and lost. ‘‘AEONS’ will bring people hope,
                aspiring to create more positive energy in people who play it. Besides that, everyone deserves to rest.
                The purpose is to give people a chance to be someone better, give them a chance to have an alternate
                life; no one is ever alone, there will always be someone with you.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main difference about AEONS compared to other games is the concept and the back story, it connects
                and relates to people who need emotional healing. In the past, games have always been about color,
                design and excitement, the game design that is being created here is much more than that. The story, the
                challenge, and the suspenseful moments of each chapter, it brings you to another level of excitement.
            </p>
