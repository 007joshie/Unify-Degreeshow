            <h2>biography</h2>

            <p>Hello, I am Shirish Rathore and I am in the process of graduating with a Bachelor of Design in Interface
                Design. I'm passionate about design in all its forms, but I'm especially knowledgeable about user
                experience and interface design. As a result of my studies at The University of Waikato, I have gained
                invaluable skills that will enable me to pursue my dream job and to further develop my design skills. My
                passions and areas of interest have narrowed down over the past three years to user experience and user
                interface design.
            </p>

            <p>
                Having been raised in India and then moving to New Zealand, my lifelong interest in computers and
                technology began. I explored a lot of topics related to computer science in my first year, which I feel
                was a great experience for me as I gained a deeper understanding of how different applications work.
                After the first year, I chose interface design as my major. While studying for my major, I had the
                chance to learn about different aspects of design that were sometimes challenging, but ultimately
                enjoyable. Each trimester, I acquired a new skill that I used in my future projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to studying, I have enjoyed meeting new people and learning about various cultures. Further,
                I have always found my lecturers to be supportive and that support has helped me concentrate on my
                sports, a passion I hope to pursue someday.
            </p>

            <h2>project description</h2>

            <p>In New Zealand, food waste is disposed of in landfills to the tune of about 2.9 million tonnes each year.
                A total of $2.4 billion in food is discarded per year in a small country like New Zealand. An estimated
                10% of food produced in restaurants and cafes ends up in the trash instead of being eaten by hungry
                people. Likewise, supermarkets and households create a great deal of food waste too.
                <br><br>
                As a member of the New Zealand community, we should all strive to prevent unnecessary food waste by
                creating more sustainable communities.
                <br><br>
                foodResQ is an initiative aimed at reducing food waste. It allows users to sell or donate their food
                products to people in their local community. By using foodResQ's proprietary location-based mobile app,
                food waste can be dramatically reduced. The app allows consumers to locate surplus food in their
                neighbourhood and redirect it to people in need.
                <br><br>
                The mission is to eradicate food waste as much as possible.
            </p>
