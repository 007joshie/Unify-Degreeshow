            <h2>biography</h2>

            <p>Hi! My name is Xinyu Min and I’ll soon graduate with a Bachelor of Design majoring in Interface Design.
                Ever since I was little, I have found arts and design very appealing and enjoyable. With a huge passion
                in photography, illustration, and graphic design, I’d like to pursue a career in the design field in the
                future.
            </p>

            <p>
                What attracts me the most about design is the ability to create and innovate. I always feel proud when I
                turn my thoughts into reality. It brings me a sense of achievement whenever I have expressed my unique
                ideas through my designs. During my time at The University of Waikato, I have gained a lot of
                design-related knowledge, which I believe has built a good foundation for my future career.
                Specifically, I have pursued my interest in UI/UX design, branding, publication, illustration,
                photography, and video production.
            </p>

            <h2>project description</h2>

            <p>Nowadays, with the strong development in technology and rapid growth in the economy, our lifestyle has
                become more abundant and a greater variety of entertainment has become available to us. However, as a
                result of the rapid technology evolution, there has been a lack of recognition in traditional skills and
                intangible culture inheritance. Some performing arts and folk customs have also been abandoned.
                <br><br>
                Although there is an increased awareness and recognition of intangible culture heritage in China, there
                are still some inevitable problems faced by this society, such as the ageing of existing inheritors and
                the lack of new inheritors. Therefore, some cultural heritages seem to be disappearing.
                <br><br>
                Our project is called ‘SINO LINK’. The aim of the project is to increase people’s awareness of
                traditional cultural heritage, through an interactive dissemination of mobile apps and websites, in the
                way of "Internet + Intangible cultural Heritage".
                <br><br>
                My role is to produce an application for the project. The "SINO LINK APP" aims to promote intangible
                cultural heritage through learning, sharing, and trading. Through the platform, users can share
                information about intangible cultural heritage that they are interested in with each other. At the same
                time, they can purchase a side-line range of products and enrol in traditional skills learning courses
                and access more intangible cultural heritage-related information. I am also responsible for designing
                posters and the side-line range of products for the project, such as stamps and canvas bags, to further
                promote our project.
                <br><br>
                Through the use of "SINO LINK", we hope more people of the younger generation will start to appreciate
                the beauty of culture and contribute to the development of cultural inheritance.
            </p>
