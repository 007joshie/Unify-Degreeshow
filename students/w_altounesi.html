            <h2>biography</h2>

            <p>Kia Ora, My name is Walla' Altounesi, and I am a third-year Bachelor of Design student, double majoring
                in Media Design and Interface Design. I will be graduating this year and hope to begin work in the
                Design industry, putting the skills I have learned at The University of Waikato to good use.
                <br><br>
                I have a Diploma from Jordan, and I used to be a graphic designer there. I came to New Zealand in 2011
                as an immigrant, but I needed to learn English, so I worked hard and tried my best to learn English and
                integrate into New Zealand society. I discovered that language is the basis for communication and
                understanding any peopleâ€™s culture; incredibly, I discovered that New Zealand is multicultural. I have
                worked in the creative industry since 2009 when I was in Jordan. I was also studying from 2008.
                <br><br>
                When I came here, I decided to complete my study, and I enjoyed all areas of design. I have chosen Media
                design and Interface design because in Jordan I had already taken communication. I liked coding, even
                though it was hard for me, and I did not get any help. I gained more skills and knowledge by doing the
                projects because we had to memorize information in Jordan, and practical work was limited. In addition,
                I am a teacher aide at a primary school, and I
                work with ESOL kids all the time.
                <br><br>
                I got the chance to gain the necessary skills and learned a lot by completing many design projects. I
                love when I design and create different types of projects because I am a visual person. I enjoy learning
                about many programs and solving problems. I also enjoy working, gaining more experience and expertise
                with my lecturers and classmates.
                I know that Waikato has been a great help because it has many subjects in Graphic Design, enabling me to
                have more skills. Waikato has helped me focus this passion for design in distinct areas and acquire the
                necessary skills. In addition, Waikato has given me so many great opportunities to link European and
                Arabic designs to help a greater range of people in New Zealand.

            <h2>project description</h2>

            <p>
                New Zealand receives many people as refugees each year and does its best to help resettle them here.
                However, some people have limited English or are non-English speakers. This makes it difficult for the
                kids to adopt, speak, and communicate with adults and children at their school.
                <br><br>
                Creating an app to help them learn English, communicate with other children, make friends, explain what
                they want, how they feel, and understand the Kiwi way of speaking will help them settle and adapt to New
                Zealand more easily and enjoy school time. It could also make their time in mainstream classes more
                productive, so, I focused my app on what I have seen that the kids need every day at school.
                <br><br>
                I found during this project one sentence can be responded to in many different ways, even though it has
                the same meaning. Children can be stuck in one response that they are familiar with, limiting their
                interactions. So, I have added the pop-up screen for more options when asked a question with some
                appropriate responses in the Kiwi way of speaking. The NZ Learners app would help students to improve
                their English and communicate with Kiwis.
