            <h2>biography</h2>

            <p>Hello! I am Briar Lakeman and I will be graduating with a Diploma in Design. Prior to studying Design, I
                completed a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing and Strategic Management. I decided that I wanted to explore
                the more creative side of business, and have thoroughly enjoyed learning about design and linking this
                with my prior knowledge in business.
                <br><br>
                I have always enjoyed design and being creative and have learnt throughout my schooling and university
                that I am more right brained than left brained! I decided to do a bachelor’s degree in business,
                specifically marketing, as I felt this would allow me to use the creative side while also requiring
                analytical thinking. From looking at the different aspects of marketing I decided that I wanted to
                explore the mediums used to communicate with consumers instead of just learning about why. I have always
                been passionate about design and knew that I wanted to further my study by learning about communication
                design. From studying design, I have developed a passion for good design and am specifically passionate
                about branding, print design and typography. I have had the opportunity to explore all different areas
                in design including app UX design and web design which has broadened my knowledge in the different
                aspects.
            </p>


            <h2>project description</h2>

            <p>The fashion industry is one of the worst industries in the world for their lack of sustainable and
                ethical practices. It is shocking to know that 10% of the world’s global carbon emissions and 20% of the
                world’s wastewater is coming from the fashion industry. To make matters worse, consumers are pushed to
                buy new clothing each season and throw away clothing that isn’t “on trend” making only 15% of clothing
                recycled or donated.
                The Conscious Consumer Project focuses on communication with fashion brand consumers, providing
                consumers with the resources they need to be aware of whether a brand is sustainable and ethical. The
                primary goal of The Conscious Consumer Project is to enable consumers to make the choice to shop
                ethically and sustainably. To help the planet, we need to be aware of what we consume in terms of
                clothing, as we tend to focus only on how cheap items are and how cool they look and we forget about the
                damage being done.
                <br> <br>
                I have developed a certification that allows consumers to recognise if they are purchasing a brand that
                employs sustainable and ethical practices. I have also created posters that show how consumers are being
                conscious and how they can learn more information about what the Conscious Consumer Project means for
                them. I have also developed a swing tag that is featured on fashion brands which includes the
                certification, and a QR code consumers can scan to learn more about what this swing tag means for them.
