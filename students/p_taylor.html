            <h2>biography</h2>

            <p>Hey! My name is Paige Taylor and I’m studying a Bachelor of Design majoring in Interface Design. I was
                originally doing a Bachelor of Business majoring in Marketing and Communication Design, but decided I
                preferred UI/UX design to branding.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’ve been doing design since Year 12 at Otumoetai College. I decided to do design as a fun project to
                offset my business-oriented papers. However, when I started at The University of Waikato, I didn’t enjoy
                doing business, and much preferred my design papers with Carolina. In my second year, I switched my
                degree to design and changed my major to Interface. I thought to myself, ‘I would rather be doing design
                as a career path’.
                <br><br>
                At Waikato, I have learnt many different skills. From how to code in different languages, to using
                different design programs such as XD, Premiere, and After Effects. I find it interesting learning about
                how different users interact with interfaces depending on when they were born, different cultures, and
                gender.
            </p>

            <h2>project description</h2>

            <p>The world has become a lot more progressive over the past few years. From countries accepting gay
                marriage, to actors coming out as part of the LGBTQ+ community. However, we still have a very long way
                to go. As the first country to allow women to vote, New Zealand should also be one of the first to
                accept the LGBTQ+ community. 3.4% of people in New Zealand identify as part of the community. Chances
                are you’ve met someone that’s LGBTQ+ and not even realized it due to them not feeling like they can come
                out.
                <br><br>
                Now they have a place to be themselves. ‘Find Your Place’ strives to create a space where the LGBTQ+
                community can feel safe.
                <br><br>
                ‘Find Your Place’ is an app that displays stores owned by supporters of the pride community. Users must
                create an account to use the features to protect the anonymity of users who aren’t ready to come out to
                friends and family. Once signed in, they can find places on the map, and navigate to them. There is also
                an event feature, so a user can discover pride related events created by LGBTQ+ members near them.
