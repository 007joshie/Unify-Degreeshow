            <h2>biography</h2>

            <p>Hi, I am Stephanie Derby and I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Design majoring in Media Design. I
                have always been passionate about art and design and have found that The University of Waikato was the
                place to explore and build my skills and knowledge.
            </p>

            <p>
                Design is always something that I wanted to do but coming to Waikato opened my eyes to the different
                areas of design and the creative scope that I could achieve. Design is so much more than drawing some
                illustrations and finding a good typeface, and I have learned and gained so much through this degree. My
                interests in design are motion graphics and illustration.
            </p>

            <h2>project description</h2>

            <p>Water is an important resource that many of us take for granted. It is a necessity for everyday life, but
                its natural sources are being depleted and pollution and water scarcity are taking hold. With
                approximately 80% of sea litter coming from the land, pollution has become a major issue, affecting both
                sea life and water quality for human consumption. Our water is being polluted with radioactive
                substances from televisions and watches, as well as industrial waste and household trash. Water scarcity
                is another issue we are facing, as many people cannot access fresh, clean drinking water and this issue
                is only increasing with climate change and further pollution. People need to change their water habits
                to make sure this is a resource everyone can access and enjoy.
                <br><br>
                My project ‘DROP’ seeks to help people change their behaviour by informing and educating younger
                audiences who are more receptive to change and likely to act. ‘DROP’ focuses on using short form
                animations and posters to educate, with a water bottle product to help users start to implement the
                changes we need to save water. The catchphrase for the project is “Change Your Water Habits”, which is
                what this project captures and encourages people to do.

            </p>
