            <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>

            <p>Hello, I'm Salma and I will be finally graduating this year! These three years was my first ever dive
                into design and it was a fun whirlwind of experiences. Whilst I've always been a creative person,
                specifically in illustrations and drawing, I've never really had the chance to learn about design until
                now. This course has broadened my knowledge and now I've got a few tools in my hand-dandy toolkit to
                take with me onto the future.
                <br><br>
                I think it's fascinating how design truly surrounds us. The screen you're reading this on. Your couch.
                Your favourite book. Your favourite album. It never really occurred to me how pivotal design is and the
                way it shapes the world until now. It's wonderful how design can bring the world together. And through
                these years, I've fine-tuned my gaze and smoothed out the edges through practice. I wouldn't say I've
                gained knowledge to the point of perfection: that doesn't exist. However, I have crafted my knowledge to
                know that I do have a little bit of talent and with hard-work and practice, anything can be possible.
            </p>
